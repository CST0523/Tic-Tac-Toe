# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against the computer. The game features a 3x3 grid where the player and the computer take turns to place their respective symbols (X or O) until there is a winner or a tie.

## How to Play

1. **Game Start**: Run the program, and you will see instructions on how to play.
2. **Choose Turn and Symbol**: You will be asked if you want to go first. If you choose "Yes," you can select your symbol (X or O). The computer will automatically take the other symbol.
3. **Making Moves**:
   - The board positions are displayed with numbers (0â€“8) for easy reference.
   - Enter the number corresponding to the position where you want to place your symbol.
4. **Winning and Tie Conditions**:
   - The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
   - If the board is filled and no one has won, the game is a tie.
5. **Play Again**: After each game, you will have the option to play again.
